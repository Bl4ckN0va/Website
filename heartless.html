<h2>What is a Heartless?</h2>
</div>
<div class="txt">
<p>Heartless are physical, living manifestations of the darkness within people's hearts.</p>
<p>They manifest in two forms; "Pureblood" and the artificially created "Emblem" Heartless.</p>
<p>They behave entirely devoid of emotion, hence the name "Heartless".</p>

<h3>Pureblood</h3>
</div>
<div class="txt">
<p>The Pureblood Heartless are natural Heartless, born when people's hearts are normally consumed by darkness.</p>
<p>They are ink-black in color, with yellow beady eyes; though they start taking on additional colors the bigger they are.</p>
<p>They are more common in places that are close to or saturated in darkness.</p>

<div class="emblemhead">
<h3>Emblem</h3>
</div>
<div class="txt">
<p>The Emblem Heartless are Heartless created in Ansem's Lab.</p> 
<p>They were created by Xehanort using the Pureblood as synthesizing material.</p>
<p>They are usually more powerful than normal Heartless and they all bear the Heartless Emblem.</p>
